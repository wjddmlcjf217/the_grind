Continguous block of memory, usually represents sequences

Retrieving and Updating takes O(1) 

Insertion and Deletion takes O(n) 
- For index i for array length of n, delete / insert takes O(n - i), which is still O(n) in the grand scheme

Given input array of integers, reorder entries so even entries appear first without additional space
- When working with arrays, take advantage of the fact we can operate on both ends
- Partition array into 3 subarrays, even, unclassified, odd
- Initially even and odd are empty, unclassified is the entire array
- Iterate through unclassified moving elements to even and odd subarrays via swaps, expanding even/odd and shrinking unclassified

def even_odd(A):
  next_even, next_odd = 0, len(A) - 1
  while next_even < next_odd:
    if A[next_even] % 2 == 0:
      next_even += 1
    else:
      A[next_even], A[next_odd] = A[next_odd], A[next_even]
      next_odd -= 1

Array problems often have simple brute.force solutions that use O(n) space, but there are subtler solutions that use the array itself to reduce space complexity to O(1).
Filling an array from the front is slow, so see if it's possible to write values from the back
Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its left), consider overwriting it.
When dealing with integers encoded by an array consider processing the digits from the back of the array. Altemately, reverse the array so the least-significant digit is the first entry.
Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays
It's incredibly easy to make off-by-l errors when operating on arrays-reading past the last element of an array is a comrnon error which has catastrophic consequences.
Don't worry about preserving the integrity of the array (sortedness, keeping equal entries together, etc.) until it is time to retum.
An array can serve as a good data structure when you know the distribution of the elements in advance. For example, a Boolean array of length W is a good choice for representing a subset of {0,'1.,. .. ,W - 1}. (When using a Boolean array to represent a subset of {'J.,2,3,.. . ,fl|, allocate anarray of sizen+1to simplifyindexing.) .
\A/hen operating on 2D arrays, use parallel logic for rows and for columns
Sometimes it's easier to simulate the specification, than to analytically solve for the result. For example, rather than writing a formula for the l-th entry in the spiral order for an n x n matrix, just compute the output from the beginning.
